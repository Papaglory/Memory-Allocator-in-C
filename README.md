# Custom Allocator in C


// Just some notes that might be useful to have written down somewhere:


For the following, there will be one implementation using the custom allocator
and one using C's allocator:

- LinkedList
- LinkedListIterator
- Node

There are kept two versions to keep as a reference implementation and for
potensial debugging. This is done my duplicating the code base.
There will be one standard version and one custom\_allocator version.
There are corresponding directories in src and build.
