## Description

This project features a battleship that autonomously navigates the map in search of enemy vessels. When an enemy vessel is encountered, the battleship engages in combat and collects the remains of the ship.

The decision-making process of the battleship is driven by utility AI, a system that uses mathematical functions and scoring systems to evaluate and prioritize actions based on their utility. This approach allows the battleship to make intelligent decisions in various scenarios, including combat and resource management.
